"I think it's taking the ""born this way"" attitude to it's reducto ad absurdum extreme. Yeah, people are born gay. But not everyone has that ""a-ha!"" moment early in life were they realize they're not like the other kids. That friend I mentioned didn't realize he was gay until he was in his early 30's. According to these asshats, though, he was ""coerced into heteronormativity"" because he had sex with a few women before he realized he liked dudes.

Everybody and their brother was ""bisexual"" in my high school days. I seriously thought my friends and I were the only people who were confirmed heteros (though one later did come out). Similarly, the majority of these people are now in hetero relationships. I think in their case it was definitely peer pressure. Especially in the crowd of punk rock angst-factories I ran with who did anything and everything to be a spectacle. 

I like to believe these people will look back at their Tumblr warrior days and cringe as much as I do when I think of my misspent youth. Their hearts are in the right place but they're not tempering their passion with an ounce of common fucking sense. Ultimately, they're only causing more harm by making it appear as though the community their championing is full of histrionic weirdos with a god damn three volume lexicon of ridiculous jargon.";;TumblrInAction;2;[deleted];;1374630068;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1ivqkz//cb8yfxl

"&gt; ""The existence of trans people makes me fear for the future. We shouldn't let them have a say in how society treats them""

I like it when people actually write down their bullshit interpretation, make it much easier to call out.

Where did they say that? Where did they say, actually, that trans people should get a say in how people treat them? Where does it say that they fear the existence of trans people? Bloody hell, I'd call this a strawman, but even straw holds up better than this shit.

Since you can't seem to comprehend things properly, let me interpret for you. /u/FunnyPseudonym seems, to me, to be lamenting the possibility that *my* day-to-day life will be noticeably impacted because of the bitching and moaning of a small population in an already minuscule fraction of the population. There are lines to be drawn, and SJW's are crossing them.

Trans people should, of course, be accepted and at the absolute least not be discriminated against. However, a business getting prosecuted because they didn't provide an bathroom for ""Neither""? That's too far.

When people do say things like ""trans don't real"", sure call them out. But I'm calling you out for being just like those SJWs that we mock. You found something to be offended about and constructed your own reality around it. At no point does FunnyPseudonym say that trans-ness isn't real, or body dymorphia or gender dysphoria. The reason why you can't see how he made that leap is because **he didn't make that leap**.";;TumblrInAction;4;Aatch;Rhetorisexual;1373706908;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1i6d6h//cb1r3cv

[It was basically what started the entire gay rights movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots). Before this event, LGBT people just sort of took it.

For whatever reason, on that night people just sort of saw it as the final straw, and ever since then queer people have decided to fight for their rights.

"Not going to read it - but hanging the destruction of the black family on the CIA isn't entirely bonkers.  Consider the Iran-Contra affair, and the concurrent smuggling of cocaine into the US by the CIA to be a big part of what fueled the problem a generation ago.  

I-C in a nutshell.  We were trying to secretly fund counter-revolutionaries in Central America.  One of the ways money was raised to do this was having the CIA smuggle cocaine into the US on US planes, then selling it.  The supply of cocaine pushed the invention/development of crack, which did a number on black communities.  Heroin was already on its way out in the 80's, and crack showed up at an opportune time(though probably not planned) to wreak maximum damage. 

Of course, other groups benefited from this scary new drug sweeping through the ghetto - and lo, the industrial-prison complex got it's footing during Nancy Regan's ""Just Say No"" 80's.  The legacy of all of the wrong-headed approaches tried to deal with drugs and criminality during this period are with us still.

Internet slacktivism isn't going to solve the problem, and it's certainly not the entire fault of the West, we do, however, share some of the blame by being the price pressure that drives up the cost of food. It's the same thing that happened during our corn-based ethanol phase that drove up the cost of everything, it didn't hurt Americans as much because we're rich, but there were [corn riots in Mexico](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/06/080604-mexico-food.html) because corn tortillas became almost unaffordable for the country's poor.";;TumblrInAction;4;calthopian;trans-Texan Californiakin;1373254414;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1htr7q//caxzmng

"That first point is true in that it could be possible, but I think that if brought over to a Western/more developed nation, that would be rare to happen, since status and the use of threats is much less important in nations without the barbarity of Sharia. I'd only advocate for that idea if the rest of the Sharia bullshit was eradicated. I just think that the concept is a nice idea that should be promoted more. 

As for the second point, more of a moral issue. I've heard stories of many Christian parents of victims who forgive the murderer because of their moral conscience. Now I don't know about you, but relatives of murderers family members tend to be a bit angry towards the murderer, do you? You should think of the rule as a ""wait, don't do this"" thing, not a ""okay, should he be hanged or not"" kind of thing. By forgiving the perpetrator, you're not directly leaving sentencing to the victim, but rather providing them an option to object. 

Keep in mind, the perpetrator isn't suddenly free; in most cases he's still punished, just not dead.";;TumblrInAction;5;IWannaFuckEllenPage;Prob[le]matic;1372738272;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1hgkrn//cau9vzn

And its pretty much pro circlejerk central. Then another *particular* posts shows up sometime and its about how broken changing gender is and the horrible social debuff that comes with it.

I made a post asking what's with everyone lately asking for sex changes (or something like that, its a month ago and I dont feel like digging through the posts).

"I sympathize with where this is coming from. Furries are probably one of the most maligned groups of people. I have heard so much gossiping and shit talking about furries just because they're furries than just about anything else. 

Struck by an experience at my super progressive school. There was a nice gay/furry guy at my school who was friendly enough but when he ""came out"" about his furriness, instantly discussed mentioned in hushed tones as a freak (admittedly a bit of a quiet, vaguely odd fellow). Furries are kinda the last socially acceptable group to be an asshole to. 

Thinking about it- well it's ridiculous to compare it to being a women or gay because as an ignorant outsider I can't think of any reason furriness needs to be more 'public' then say bdsm or for sake of this exercise- scat/piss/blue waffle fetishes. If you walk around kinked up or cross dressed (or insert public fetishness) then you open yourself up to that kind of behavior, but the people are being a bit of an asshat. I've definitely been a bit of a hypocrite but I feel a little bad for these people.

"Hello, Yes I think it goes without saying the people who were abusing her on twitter were obviously idiots and were not justified, just like the people who abuse anyone (even Nick Griffin or eeeven Katie Hopkins) are idiots. I don't doubt that people were saying idiotic things about her after her shows, but Question Time was when she got on the radar of people who read that blog as a 'twat of the week,' or 'person who it's ok to take the piss out of' or whatever.

 I would dispute that the abuse of Griffin and Beard was different (if that's what you're saying, if it's not...:/), it was both brigading and there was massive abuse of Griffin, the way he looks, his eye, his weight and everything about him. The number of people engaging with his ideas like you was minimal, this is a theme of twitter. What ideas can you engage with people in 140 characters, it's good for jokes with friends and bon mots and inanities from celebrities.

 I think part of the problem is the difference in what words mean between the 'high culture' of academics an journalists etc, where everybody is politically correct and people will be shocked if somebody says fuck, and the kind of 4Chan, Youtube comment, Tumblr etc internet culture, where invective and hyperbole is expected, used liberally  and ultimately means much less a lot of the time.  In a somewhat different way I think that it might be frustration that you've spent lots of hours making this tv show and all you get from some people is 'you're ugly' etc. I know that lots of the sport writers at the guardian get super frustrated that most of the comments under their articles are people mocking them, or talking about superficial things and Robert Fisk wrote an article about how much he hates his comments sections. I imagine that they want to think of their audience studiously engaging with their ideas, but when reading or watching tv that seems not to happen all that much, lots of people do it just to pass the time.  
 I really don't know how to solve the problem, I think it will probably get worse.";;TumblrInAction;2;lurker093287h;;1375230560;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1jcs8h//cbdpj84

"In any given thread, there's no guarantee you'll get a representative sample of the people here. Look at this thread - I don't recall seeing a single post saying all feminists are crazy. Moreover, phrasing can matter, as does context, and so sometimes people get up- (or down-) voted for how they come across, rather than for what they *meant*.

The crazies may not define the label - although they would disagree - but they are *far* too influential as part of the movement, often assuming leadership roles, as well as making up a large portion of the academic portion of the movement (which creates the social theory which drives much of the development of feminism as a movement). When the academics and the leaders of the movement are the crazies, trying to reclaim the label on an individual basis is a lost fight. If you want to seriously try to reclaim the movement from the crazies... well, more power to you, and I wish you the best of luck, but you're not even a part of the fight if you're simply being sane and calling yourself a feminist - it's an internal political struggle in the feminist movement.";;TumblrInAction;2;DuckQueue;il deuce;1373421591;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1hy4a9//caze8k3
"&gt; And soon, at that tender age of six, I began my first diet and my decent into self loathing, body hate, and depression.

Are you fucking kidding me? You were dieting not slitting your wrists.

I am raging here. I really fucking doubt this person knows what it is like to be depressed but assuming they do: get help. Go to a doctor, get whatever pills and therapy you need so that you can motivate yourself. And then exercise and diet until you are happy with your body.

Problem fucking solved.

But instead you could spend decades without making any changes to your life, continuing the behaviours that got you to where you are. You could blame others for not letting you play organised sports instead of organising some yourself or just exercising alone. You could paint yourself as the consummate victim and waddle, head held high, towards an early death.

If your depression arises because of circumstances within your reach you can change them. You may need help from others - treatment, companionship, encouragement - but it can be done.

Every time I try to do something I like I sabotage it. I don't want to allow myself to be happy. I want to atrophy and die. This is me with the medication. It lets me get up in the morning and hide my thoughts and feelings from others. This is depression. It's like being hungry because you're dieting only you're hungry for an excuse to end it all.

"Who falls in love with someone after five dates

If they've been on five dates and Buck still hasn't disclosed that he's a famous porn star then I think that's worse than not disclosing that he's trans.

A trans person should be able to disclose details about their private life when they feel
comfortable and safe to do so without being accused of lying or being dishonest. They do not owe it to any other person, especially one they don't know that well, to divulge such private and emotionally exhausting information.

It is a lose-lose but it's better than having to say ""I'm transgendered"" to a person they do not know is worth the risk or how they will react, which is demeaning to someone who is simply trying to have a normal life and be the gender they identity as.

"This does sound like a child abuse though, *IF* what is written is true and not exagerated.

Sure, it is great to go for a walk. But it is not good to ignore when a child is throwing up. And 2 hours is not too long, yeah. However this OP was probably not used to walking more than 15 minutes at time. It is dumb to force a person to exercise when she is obviously not enjoying it.  You are not aiming to get this person exercise just this one time, you want her to exercise regularly, after all.

And that part about only allowing only one meal is really fucked up. This is totally not how you should do it and it's not healthy at all. 

It is either that the stepmother had good intentions and was painfully dumb, or the stepmother was a messed up sadist.

"I don't actually taste names or words. I project and hear colors. Words and names and numbers all have different colors and colors themselves have their own sounds. The word ""green"" for example, I actually see as a pale yellow. But the color green makes a low-pitch, mellow sound, like plucking the low E on a guitar.

Edit: I suppose I do tend to get off to a better start with some people with ""pleasant"" names though. I've noticed a correlation between how their name feels/sounds and the color I associate with it. More pleasing names have more pleasing colors and so as a result I like thinking about them more. My favorite female name so far is Mary (a very soft lavender color) and my favorite male name is John (sort of a warm blue).

"That sounds completely awful. You have to be aware, bullies are going to bully you no matter what. 

On the other side I guess people don't realize that everyone has insecurities.
 
This reminds me of a guy who I was making out with and whom I was probably going to hook up later, I suddendly straddle him and he just tells me: ""Why are your hipbones poking out, you're so boney"". Damn, I'm skinny but my hipbones are large and they poke out a bit. I’m pretty sure he didn’t realize what he was saying (most guys with a boner don’t) or he thought it was a compliment but I was very self conscious of my hip bones for a while after that.

I wish a lot of people in TiTP understood that just because you’re skinny you’re not perfect or don’t have any self esteem issues or nobody bullies you. Just because you’re not obese it doesn’t mean that you’re emaciated, or that you don’t have relationship issues.

"&gt;If this hypothetical straight guy still needs to be told then they must pass very well and there's a greater chance of them not having a problem with it compared to someone who does not pass very well.

Ok, so this comment strikes me as REALLY hypocritical.  You're saying that all trans people are evident, and it's up to the straight person to scrutinize and tell that they are actually the opposite sex.

Also, most people date because they hope that date will turn into a relationship.  Let's say a woman went on a date with a trans individual like [Buck Angel](http://worldofwonder.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/1006736550_25a35993d7.jpg)(who is a FtM trans who still has a vagina) and he doesn't tell her what's going on downstairs.  They hit it off, and have a few more dates.  Maybe they've made out some and she's been fantasizing about marrying him and starting a family, maybe some naughty fantasizing too.  So on date five Buck is comfortable enough to tell her he biologically is a woman, and doesn't have male parts.  This woman, who has NO interest in female parts, has now had her heart crushed.  She was falling in love with him, but he doesn't have what she needs to be sexually fulfilled.  She may even be averse to interacting with female parts (true cis DOES exist) and can't provide him with what HE wants.  It's lose all around because Buck wasn't honest.";;TumblrInAction;0;RedPhalcon;Get your gaze off of my flair!;1372795080;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1hgsev//caup34m

Tumblr SJWs, and the article itself, have led me to believe that no one chooses to be fat.  If that is the case, that quote makes no sense.  If people don't get fat through poor diet and lack of exercise, then none of us would think it could be us, because our choices have nothing to do with our weight.

"Have you heard of Derrida's deconstruction? It's this sort of philosophical argument that argues, more or less, that everything ever written contains so much innate bias that it's completely worthless.

Tumblr's ""check your privilege"" deal is kind of like saying ""We want to apply full deconstruction to every single opinion on this website"" and the result is that anyone who has 'bias', which we can now define clearly as ""anyone who hasn't faced the struggles I have - be they real or imagined"", has their opinion and contribution automatically rendered completely worthless.

For example, I follow two people: good friends, both white, one a gay man and the other an FtM transgender currently going through the conversion process who's interested in girls (I don't know if the label lesbian works here anymore. Whatever.).  Anyway, when the DOMA decision was repealed a couple months ago, their deconstructionist ideals towards the decision were that: 1. because the granting of their rights was spearheaded by white cis gay men, the granting of their rights is worthless and 2. because the Voting Rights Act had been repealed two days before, the Supreme Court's bias renders the DOMA decision ineffective and not 'fit for use', regardless of the undeniable fact that repealing DOMA would benefit both of these people.

Were anyone to disagree with them, or even celebrate their newfound rights, they would immediately demand that the reveling party ""check their privilege"", and then proceed to ruthlessly deconstruct their enjoyment of gay rights from a Derrida-esque perspective.

"They made it almost literally impossible for Krogans to reproduce, in that all of them were infected and almost all pregnancies would miscarry inevitably. I think words like sterility are thrown around but apparently that's not how it actually works, it works by inevitably inducing miscarriage of the zygote/foetus. Wrex also alludes to this massive loss of pregnances when he says: ""If you want to see a genocide, go to a Krogan Obstetrician's office."" The other problem is that they have a massively high birth rate, meaning a shit ton of dead foetuses, and are so war-like that they could never gather together long enough to repopulate their territories, thus they are an endangered species.

I'm not saying they negated the emotional impact of it, but at least my impression of it was that they toned down the scale of its effect. Mordin says they recalibrated the successful-birth-rate to pre-industrial levels. The Krogans were late developers of technology and were a prey-species until they industrialised, and only then became the dominant species on their planet. ""Pre-industrial-levels"" doesn't sound nearly as bad as ""99.99999% of foetuses"" or something.

I don't begrudge Mordin his involvement in it either. I think the writers handled it quite well in the series, and in a lot of ways you could say he was similar to Oppenheimer or someone like that, who was involved in creating something necessary (a way to end the Krogan rebellion) but which would do so at incredible cost (the eventual extinction of the Krogans). My only beef is that they toned down just how horrible it was, or at least they tried to explicate it by saying ""Oh, it's just pre-industrial levels"". If I was Mordin I'd feel the same way he did about his work, and if I was Wrex I would have killed the entire Normandy crew to get Saren's cure.

The Genophage is the Atomic Bomb of the ME universe. It is the greatest achievement and the greatest sin in war that the Council Races ever committed, and against such close friends, too.

"Fedoras and neckbeards are associated with Athiests usually, who insist on science, evidence etc but are technically SJW's.

Around the time when social justice turned anti-science, anti-male and anti-fact, Athiests were more or less rejected from the SJW community, a bunch of them turned MRA or were already. Dawkins being the most popular example, he refused and fought the ""feels before reals"" postmodern mentality that SJWs use today.

"The key difference to remember (And I'm not justifying bullshit that happens on either the feminist front or the MR front) is that feminist organizations have actual power to influence law changes, and what gets heard on a political level, whilst MR groups don't.

Because of this, feminists have a monopoly of gender politics, and are the only ones at the moment being taken seriously enough to change anything... 

So when feminist groups such as the NWO start opposing mens rights, it takes Mens Rights from being unheard of, to automatically being dismissed, and therefore none of the problems ever manage to get traction. This is the problem, and this is why there is a 'war'. 

However, of course, not all feminists condone what the NWO has done. ";;TumblrInAction;5;AnimusCorpus;;1373431850;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1hy4a9//cazi0y8

"""Uppity"" actually has racial connotations dating back to times of segregation in the South. It was common to refer to a black person as ""getting uppity"" if they were to do things like start businesses, organize meetings, or basically said by whites when blacks were asking to be treated as equals. ""Those uppity niggers are demanding we let them in our schools again?!""

I assumed this was well-known but it may depend on where you are from.

"Do these special snowflakes not understand how *rare* actual trans people are?

Hypothetically speaking, if I were to date someone and not realize that they were MtF, when relations actually are about to occur, and suddenly penis... this trans person is dishonest, and a subsequent breakoff of the relationship is both justified and understandable.

That's not to say that trans people should immediately mention they're equipped in ways the other person doesn't expect on the first date, but as a trans it becomes your responsibility to advise your SO at the appropriate time.

I hate it when people say that fast food is cheaper than regular food. The reason people eat it is because it is more convenient and they are tired/ lazy. I spent twenty dollars the other day on cooking a meal for six people, handmade ravioli and a zucchini gratin. And I even splurged a little and got some high class specialty ingredients. When I was living hand to mouth I ate frozen pasta and cheap meat from the grocery store with frozen vegetables and my weekly food budget was about 50 bucks.

"Yo, if people are getting on you for ""not being queer enough"" they are asshats and you shouldn't give them the time of day.  People that have known you for a while might think it's a phase at first, but they will hopefully eventually catch on.  And some of the smarter people might realize that the ultra-feminine person you were trying to be was the phase and that this person is the real you (because I know that some of my more perceptive longtime friends figured that out quickly for me).

I'm white, but I feel with you for the ""minority-within-a-minority"" thing, as I'm also asexual.  I know it's not the same because one's visible and the other's not among other things.

Just them being subscribed to a couple of trans* related subreddits wouldn't be enough for me to be comfortable, I have shared them with people, but they were other trans* people I have talked to for months now, been on cam with multiple times, etc. Something close to that? If you want to get in, have to be active in the trans* community here for like a month and a half or something, have your post history be vetted by a mod before you get in, and maybe have to give up a few (non-nude) pictures as collateral?

"&gt; SHE is not the military, so it doesn't matter if it was prejudicial to her...only if it was prejudicial to GO&amp;D and/or service discrediting. Since those two are specifically mentioned as additional requirements, I think it's safe to assume that the act of adultery in and of itself does not satisfy them. 

This is prejudicial to GO&amp;D as he misrepresented himself as a single military member therefore bringing the service into disrepute which lowers it in public esteem .  If this isnt then what is?  Is it only sleeping with another military person?

I agree that one can be somewhat child-free and not plan on getting an abortion.  I think a lot of people on child-free are rabidly against having kids to the point where they insist that the proper response to personal questions is rudeness.  I'm here because I don't want children now, and I want to explore why I want children (25 years in the future) without having a logical reason.  This is just like the question of can you be a feminist without being pro-choice. The answer is yes, but it's less common.;;childfree;2;jrl2014;;1373657300;https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1i3usu//cb1d8rg

Help them earn an armor set. I did this with my brther the other day. He liked fighting Barroth so we just kept smashin him and building the set. He finally got all the parts and was pretty happy about it. Pick a weapon or armor to work towards and farm the bosses. Take turns helping eachother progress. Once you fight a boss a few times you get to know its moves better and it can be a lot more fun.;;MonsterHunter;1;rabidcavy;;1372776423;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1hhk9u//cauhx40

Because the Switch Axe is so useful. The reach is so big and the weapon is so deep. Switching from sword to axe at the right time, the different phials, the infinite combos, the sword charge attack, side stepping AND dodging- I could go on and on.

"Honestly, i went back and farmed him once i got more powerful weapons.  Like a dragon weapon comes to mind or something with crazy ice.  

Most likely to make the set+weapon you are going to have to do it a tonne of times too.

sadly i still need about 15 elder dragon bloods for 3 weapons.  And i have a full goldbeard set plus a bunch of other gear that used dragon bloods.  I fucking hate dragon bloods so i am just leaving the weapons behind and as i get further into G rank i will just do higher level content to get them for my lower level content gear.";;MonsterHunter;1;Esham;;1374513593;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1isqoa//cb7wt22

"Well a full digitizer isn't cheap.  You're not just paying the extra for the plastic stylus.

With Haswell apparently being so power efficient that it rivals ARM, what is the point of Bay Trail going to be?

I just find it weird that the main Intel x86 CPU line is now going to be anywhere was efficient as an ARM chip.

For something like this ThinkPad tablet, and what I plan to do with it, I would prefer it to have longer battery life than power, so would probably prefer Bay Trail to Haswell (if Bay Trail is more power frugal and as long as it's still powerful enough to decode streamed HD video).";;thinkpad;2;eggbean;755C, X30, X31, X40, X200s, X220, X301;1375136343;https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1jb1e6//cbcvkuo

"&gt;...I'm disappointed that they've removed the power on fingerprint scan feature.

I missed that bit.  That is a little bit of a disappointment, as I use that all the time.  

Aside from my long-standing dismay regarding the keyboard layout and lack of proper trackpoint buttons, these are some exciting developments coming to the X-series.  I don't even think the single DIMM slot is going to be much of a real issue.  There was something else that I was a little concerned about, but I cannot remember what it was at the moment.

I'm also sceptical that the claimed 6hr battery life also applies with the FHD option.";;thinkpad;1;eggbean;755C, X30, X31, X40, X200s, X220, X301;1374377389;https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/1iq0sk//cb6zqwh
