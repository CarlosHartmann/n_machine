"&gt;You missed the point entirely, which is that practically anything kills cells in cultures. The XKCD comic is a extreme example of this.

Nonsense, if that's the case then it's an idiotic example - pointing out that a *handgun* kills cells in cultures does nothing to indicate that *practically anything* kills cells in cultures.

Handguns can also be used to kill numerous animals which are, in fact, rather hard to kill. It's not like getting shot is mild trauma.

An extreme example of something that destroys cells in cultures would be something like water, which you mentioned. That's an ""extreme example"" because water does not usually kill things it comes into contact with.

&gt;Then back your stance up with actual science, not a test on a cell culture that would produce the same results with a huge variety of other substances that are consumed in far greater quantities than glyphosate.

Can you provide me with a link to these alleged studies in which it was demonstrated that *human DNA* is destroyed on contact by these things? I've tried googling, but the only things I can find are either from extraordinarily disreputable sources (NaturalNews, for instance) or are simply warnings for handling samples of DNA in labs (Which do not include lists of what not to pour on them).

&gt;But you're basing your concerns on a study that can be replicated with a wide variety of different substances with no change in the results. Even water can kill cells in vitro, although it does a poor job of doing so.

I'm aware of this. The issue here is that perhaps we should hold off and *make sure* that Roundup isn't going to give a huge number of people cancer before we allow it to continue to be used.

"&gt; I think advice like ""don't hang out in dodgy areas at night"" is more helpful personally. What isn't helpful is acting like all men are potential rapists and deluding yourself into thinking that the small minority who actually are potential rapists can simply be ""educated"" into not being rapists.

Statistically, the small minority of women dim enough to hang out in dodgy areas at night without sufficient reason (such as shortcut, roadblocks, or they need to be on that exact block for one reason or another) are at less risk of getting raped in this dodgy area at night than at their own home, or the home of a friend or a partner. A friend of mine used to live on a block where a serial rapist was attacking people. Her parents were scared shitless, especially since the guy had assaulted their elderly relative's caretaker (same apartment complex). It's not always possible to reroute your entire day and trajectory to avoid the minuscule chance of a psycho lurking.

Meanwhile, while I know of this one instance of a stereotypical deranged rapist waiting around in darkened vestibules, I know quite a few more instances of girlfriends having been assaulted by men they were seeing, who they were in relationships with, or friends with. Guys who waited for them to be passed out drunk to have sex with them. Guys who did not consider ""no, stop"" to mean ""no, stop"" until scratching and kicking was involved. A guy who said, ""But you slept with [him], so why not me?"" A boyfriend who thought that threatening the girl with a knife and her crying was foreplay. These are men who aren't stigmatized as rapists, who have girlfriends and female friends and respect their mothers, and yet somewhere in their minds is a disconnect that goes ""at this time, this particular girl is fair game, regardless of how she feels."" That disconnect wasn't brought on by dark alleys or a show of cleavage, it was brought on by how our society views sex and male and female sexuality.

TL;DR: ""Don't walk through a dark alley"" is good general advice. But giving it as anti-rape advice specifically does not take into account where and how most rapes happen, and by posing as a valid solution, detracts from more productive conversations we might have on the nature and rationalization of rape, and the cultural forces that can perpetuate or deter it.";;TumblrInAction;25;coldcoldiq;transatlantic;1370799746;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1fz5ar//cafc8g7;

"Good news, the people who you feel you disagree with actually agree with you on this!  The sane ones call what you're describing ""sex"", rather than ""gender"".  

Gender tends to be defined as all the traits that aren't biological but make up the _identity_ associated with being male or female.  i.e.  Crying from frustration is kinda acceptable for women, but not for grown men.  That sort of thing is where the male/man female/woman split comes from.  You're absolutely right that someone's underlying biology, barring medical intervention, will remain unchanged.  However, their identity can be a lot more fluid.

Then it comes down to the question:  Do people have a right to an identity that differs from their biology?  Can someone who is born a male acquire the identity of a woman and assume that role?  What if they are only adopting some of the aspects of one role while keeping others?  What behaviors and rights/privileges are attached to each role, anyway?

Generally, outside of SJW circles, ""I don't care what the fuck you do as long as you realize that anything weird will have to be explained and I still may not take you seriously"" is an acceptable answer.

"&gt;**Dear White Atheists Crying Out For Oppression Points**

&gt;Let’s do a little exercise here:

Why not?

&gt;Is our country at war with an atheist nation, murdering atheist children in the name of god and xenophobicly curbing the rights of immigrants from Atheist-land at home?

Not quite, but the rhetoric coming from Fox News comes pretty close

&gt;Has anyone ever put a burning upside-down cross on your lawn to send you a signal that you are not allowed in that neighborhood?

No, but there are current laws banning atheists from running for office.

&gt;Is the current socio-econimic system biased against your social mobility and predicated on centuries of enslaving and exploiting your atheist ancestors?

Actually, yes. Try being an atheist in the 1600s and see how long it takes before you're burned at the cross

&gt;Have you been fired or humiliated at your workplace because your coworker saw your same-atheist partner pick you up from work and kiss you on the mouth, giving off the impression that you care nothing for family values?

...people have been fired for being atheist, dawg.

&gt;Can people tell you are an atheist from afar, giving plenty of notice for them to flood their mind with every stereotype about people who look like you, including your alleged inadequacies and other socially Darwinistic shortcomings?

No, but people have been forced to hide their atheist leanings.

&gt;Are you sexualized and mentally stunted in advertisements based on the way the media decides atheists should look and act, despite the fact that there are atheists of all sizes and temperment?

Some people still see atheists as ""godless heathens"", actually

I could go on, but the point is that if we're judging oppression by the risk of losing one's job and by historical oppression, atheists are pretty high up there.

But if we instead judge oppression based on what opportunities we have *today* instead of what opportunities we had centuries ago or what's going on across the globe, then this entire game becomes stupid and pointless.";;TumblrInAction;10;[deleted];;1370508339;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1frxge//cad8n3x;
"If they're mocking a trans-man's identity, yes.

Well sometimes, at other times FtM are vile traitors to the cause and worse than 'real men' because they betrayed them. You never know with TERFs, it's one extreme or the other. 

Edit: Oh, unless you mean male/female vs man/woman in which case it's still used in a mocking way often, irrespective of identity vs biological sex. It's also an amusing point to make about how TERFs adamantly oppose the idea that they're defined by being born female and yet happily turn around and reduce Trans* people because of the sex they were born as. I don't really want to delve into certain blogs to pull up examples, but the basis of it is any argument that supports their views but can also support trans* people only applies when it support them because trans* people rape women's bodies simply by existing.";;TumblrInAction;2;[deleted];;1370106054;https://www.reddit.com/r/TumblrInAction/comments/1feuu4//caa5hqt;

"&gt;I can't see how a person who just doesn't want sex would become known as a ""creepy recluse"" or ""crazy cat-lady""

That's not really my point. I'm not saying that all people like that are asexual, or all asexuals become like that. It's more an example of how society looks down upon people because they are not in relationships, sexual or otherwise. You pretty much cannot argue that a major way society judges someone's value is by their ability to form romantic and/or sexual relationships with other people, and that's not particularly fair. 

&gt;And it isn't necessarily backwards thinking that leads people to the wrong conclusions. The asexual person just isn't common enough in society that people can immediately asses them as being such. It's backwards thinking that leads people to believe everyone else should have the same capacity and knowledge as themselves. Which gets people ridiculed, neglected, and possibly even harmed, in the worst and most uncommon of scenarios.

I'm not arguing that society as a whole should have to assess people as being asexual immediately. That's not what is backward thinking. No matter what, some people are just going to be bad at assessing other people, so it's pointless to worry about that. The backward thinking is making judgement calls about someone's value to society based on their relationship status and desire to have sex.

It strongly reminds of fundamentalism (of any belief). Many adherants of a belief/faith are pretty reasonable, good people. Fundamentalists just take their beliefs to insane levels for the SOLE purpose of pleasing/looking good to their fundamentalists peers (if there was no community to support them/eachother, they would not be fundamentalist). Additionally, they bastardize the very beliefs they claim to champion, similar to how sjw's bastardized the legitimate ideas in /u/ervin2's post.

Began living as a man roughly full-time (I was in the military) in 2010. I started T and went 100% full-time in November 2012 (was discharged from the military). I am getting top surgery in September 2013. My passport and IDs say male. My name was legally changed. All that happened in the end of 2012.

Mentally, I was done transitioning as soon as I got on T. I don't feel like I need support or anything. The top surgery is just for me and I happened to have the time and funds on hand. My breasts were small enough I didn't have to bind to pass.

I call myself bi but honestly I don't know what my sexuality is. It's not too concerning for me since I'm 100% fine with being single. Been leaning toward 'demisexual' label, lately, though.

At the moment, I am stealth. And will likely remain so for the forseeable future.

Seconding the other comment and giving some reasoning to drive the point home - first impressions stick, hard.

"""Entitled?"" ... ""petulant?"" ... these things could be said about a small percentage of officers in any AFSC.  Assholishness is universal.  Honestly, I met more jackasses when I was a maintainer than I ever met as a pilot.  For the most part, pilots have been getting their pills kicked in since 9/11 and haven't raised their eyes long enough to worry about shit like this.  They're working as hard as any career field and collecting what the AF offers them ... which it does -- trust me on this because I worked in the bonus shop -- not out of kindness or emotion of any sort, but because it believes it is in the service's strategic interest or doesn't have enough SA to make a risky decision to the contrary.  Quit looking at this through the individual scope, which makes you all look like crybabies.

What gets forgotten is that we owe the nation a response capability that could claim the lives of pilots on a mass scale.  Should that happen, we need replacements to carry on the fight.  Having extra pilots is a strategic hedge.  Don't take it personally.  If you don't like feeling undervalued, compete for pilot training.  Or separate and join the US Army.

This gave me about 2 hits before i would die instead of one. 30 minutes i finally dropped him to the ground and with my bow raised high i drew my final arrows right into his stomache only this wasnt enough. Ten more minutes with enough health for one thunder attack i scurried side to side diving and rolling through every charge and attack. This is it i thought. The beast fell once more only this time i wasnt letting him get up. A point blank lvl 3 charge left the kirin with no more than a wiggle and a loud roar before the beast was slain.

"If you're soloing, try not to.

Seriously.
However, if you HAVE to solo though (like if you're on 3DS), then make sure you're matching the elemental weakness of the monster you're fighting. 

With Bow, SnS and DS, there can be NO EXCEPTION in this case. These weapons have garbage raw damage; it's part of the weapon's weakness to keep it 'balanced' if you will.

The plus side of Bow, SnS and DS is that they have a tremendous amount of element/status effect damage. This coupled with the frequency in which they hit is game-breaking at times (see Kebli Bow.)

"You're still pretty early int he game, so don't worry about it. Here are a few tips I can come up with off the top of my head: 

* Bouncing reduces your sharpness faster and often means you're hitting a part of the monster that takes less damage. The higher your sharpness color the less you'll bounce.
* Sharpness not only affects bouncing but also damage. Green is considered neutral for damage, anything below and you take penalty, anything above and you get bonus damage. 
* Monsters stay in traps longer when they're drooling, less when they're in rage mode. Repeated use of the same trap type makes that monster stay in them less. 
* You may find some monsters easier to fight with one weapon type over another, it's recommended that you find multiple weapon types that you're comfortable with so that you have a backup. 
* Skills are often more important than defense on armor. You can easily upgrade armor for more defense, but getting more skills on the same set can be difficult for now. 
* If a monster pins you, rotate the left analog and mash buttons to get out quicker.
* Dual blades work best with element, so try and make a pair for each element. 
* Paintballs and maps will be your friends.
* NEVER SELL EARTH CRYSTALS. EVER. You will need stupid amounts of them later.
* If you're having trouble with a monster, try going in and just watching its movements. Look for when it holds still and when it starts its attacks so you can learn when to dodge and when you have a big opening to attack.

All cost of the materials for the whole class was $50.  This included aluminum stock for a smaller injection molding project (a poker chip), aluminum for a picture frame, and the two 6xsomething(I forgot how thick they were) aluminum die plates.  The two die plates were like $18 a piece I think.

Just messing with you, still a good find.

Some tips I've learned:
Exercise- I'm not the most in shape guy or anything, but honestly, taking a few hours off during the week to just run or play tennis or BE OUTSIDE can do the body (and mind wonders) it really helps.

Good food- Treat yourself!

"I couldn't agree more - when I peruse subs like this one between semesters, I find tons of great links and explanations that were almost impossible to find when I was actually taking the courses.

It sounds like we're thinking very much along the same lines here - one of my biggest concerns with this project has been long-term stability of the associated materials. All too often links break, sites go down, files disappear, and as you mentioned, material just gets buried in a heap of unorganizable data. This is kind of a conundrum, because it isn't exactly ideal to either host all of the content locally or periodically comb gigabytes worth of material for anything that is dead/broken/unorganized.

I am loving all of the ideas coming out of this thread. The ones you mentioned are especially viable, and I actually have a bit of a start on exactly those kinds of things. I am hoping to expand it by cross-referencing classes between universities and finding supplementary material online. I have seen a few university societies that keep old exams, problem sets, and notes, and hope to incorporate stuff like that as well.

At this point, it looks like I'll be using a combination of google sites and a free wiki to at least get things started. Once I have a solid framework in place, I'll post the link back here for anyone who might want take a look or help out!

Maybe so, but I agree that death threats are over the line. I also think any insult that brings 'cis' into the mix is just as fucked up as any one that would bring 'trans' into it.

"Controllability of a statically unstable or marginally stable aircraft is a huge safety issue.  If the air data sensors on a traditional bodied aircraft fail or ice-up, the pilots can fly blind by trimming the aircraft to emergency mandated values.  With no air data on a flying wing, controllability becomes a severe issue.

That being said, the B-2 crash was a tough one because so much of the aircraft design centers around stealth (flush mounted air data sensors...).  There are a ton of off-the-shelf options for air-data sensors that shouldn't fail and have a huge amount of commercial flight hours on them.

I think the safety risk plays a huge part in the airlines'/FAA's willingness to take the leap, which leaves no incentive for airframers to develop the aircraft.";;AskEngineers;4;Wyoming_Knott;Mechanical - Aircraft ECS/Thermal;1370390099;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1fnuwy//cacamnu;

"Clean out everything that's not needed in the glove box.  Open any sealed containers and let them sit for a couple of hours.  In fact, watch the H2O and see if it increases after opening the sealed containers, if it does then there's one issue.  In the meantime figure out what the deal is with your catalyst, or (easier, probably smarter) just overhaul everything and document exactly what you're doing, moving forward.  (i.e. what did you buy, how much, from where, and when did you run the regen)  Then re-run your regeneration and see what happens.  Seal up the containers again and hopefully you're good to go.  Don't forget to double check all the gloves for leaks...
